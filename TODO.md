Introduce a "shuffle windows to second monitor" feature its not really a shuffle, but I move all the active windows to another workspace on the second monitor, and i'll have to move them over one by one until the workspace is empty, switch to a new workspace on the first monitor, move to the workspace on the second monitor and move the windows over on the second monitor on the same numbered workspace where they were on the first monitor.
