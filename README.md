#  Benjamin Shawki's dotfiles
These are my dotfiles and they are inspired by the book [Building a mouseless environment](https://themouseless.dev/), by Mattieu Cneude.
Don't just copy paste my files, they are specific to my configuration and my configuration in combination with the glove80 keyboard.
